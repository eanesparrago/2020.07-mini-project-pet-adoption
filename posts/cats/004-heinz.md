## Heinz’s Story

Heinz’s story began as a simple TNR operation around Greenhills. Rescuers were pleasantly surprised when this kitty approached them, with absolutely no bait needed! When presented at our clinic, Heinz was underweight, and covered in a fungal infection that left his fur patchy. His eyes were also bloodshot and streaming mucus.

Though when it came time to return him to Greenhills, a volunteer practically begged the staff for a chance to foster the little guy. And how could we not accept? In time, Heinz returned to PARC, where he prances around the cattery, begging passing strangers for scratches.

### Ideal Home

Heinz will be happy in a home where he will be safe and well fed. He only needs some regular cleaning around his eyes, plus loooootttss of cuddles.
