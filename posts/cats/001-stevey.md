## Stevey’s Story

All is fair in love and war, as they say. And just like in war, love can have casualties as well. Sometimes, those casualties are innocent animals, and that’s where PAWS steps in. Stevey was brought in for euthanasia because of extenuating circumstances. Essentially, a woman had recently married a man who happened to be allergic to cats. The woman had to choose between her feline friend or her betrothed.

Though we commend her for taking the responsible option and not throwing away Stevey like garbage, we decided that he shouldn’t be put down for something as simple as an incompatible home. Instead, the handsome Stevey got a second chance, and all parties left happily.

### Ideal Home

Stevey is frequently found sitting near the windows of the cattery, watching for his next family. He doesn’t ask for much — just a roof over his head and someone to give him scratches every now and then.
