## Kallie’s Story

Deep in the urban jungles of Filinvest 2, Quezon City, a small kitten mewled for its mother. Kallie was a very small kitty when she was rescued from a busy street, a very dangerous place for such an inexperienced feline to be. Yet she had no choice, as her mother was nowhere to be found. A good Samaritan, noticing Kallie’s plight, called PAWS to request a rescue. Luckily, the rescue was a near total success, asides from Kallie’s bad habit of walking towards moving vehicles.

Today, Kallie is one of the longest standing shelter residents, and eagerly awaits a forever home.

### Ideal Home

Kallie is generally cheerful and adaptable, so she has no special requirements. Her ideal home is the usual for a feline, loving and with plenty of places to snooze. She has not been socialized around dogs yet, and may take some getting used to.
