## Pilita’s Story

Pilita was found under a parked car inside of the compound of the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR). Apparently, she was hit by a car days before and her hind legs had become paralyzed. She was fortunate to have been found before she deteriorated and starved to death. We didn’t think that she would be able to walk again but she surprised us all. Only less than a year later, she is strolling around the dog run looking healthier than ever, asking for ear scratches and cuddles!

### Ideal Home

Pilita doesn’t need anything special, just a comfortable home with loving humans for company. She gets along with everybody, so she will surely fit right in wherever she goes.
