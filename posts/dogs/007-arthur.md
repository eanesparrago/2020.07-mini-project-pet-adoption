## Arthur’s Story

Extremely malnourished, full of mange, no tail – these are the things rescuers first noticed when they saw “King Arthur” in the streets of Sampaloc, Manila last 2018.

Fast forward to today, the once thin and sickly dog is almost unrecognizable. In just under a year, King Arthur has recovered with no sign of malnourishment, mange or past ill treatment. King Arthur, befitting of his name, now proudly flaunts his healthy body and beautiful light brown fur, positively waiting for a new family he can call home. He is also a graduate of our dog behavioral class, having learned basic obedience skills within a few short weeks!

### Ideal Home

Arthur is known in PAWS as one of the their most energetic tenants. An active home with owners who commit to doggy activities like long walks and playing catch would be an ideal home for this king. He would also love kids to play with. However, other dogs may find his strong personality too overwhelming.
