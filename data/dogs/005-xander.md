## Xander’s Story

Xander had been one of many street dogs roaming the concrete jungle of Quezon City, unattended and unloved, her situation made even more dire by the severe strain upon her bladder and kidneys. When Xander was presented at the clinic, she displayed severe symptoms such as hematuria, or the presence of blood in her urine, constipation, and horrible pain when touched in the general area of her bladder.

Today, she has recovered and has become one of the friendliest dogs at the shelter. We are hoping for the day when she doesn’t have to be confined in a kennel anymore.

### Ideal Home

Xander won’t ask for much — just a safe, loving home where he gets lots of affection from his humans. He wouldn’t mind having a little human sibling, or even a furry one!
