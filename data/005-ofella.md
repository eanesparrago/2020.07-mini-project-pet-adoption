## Ofella’s Story

It was just another day for Ofella as she roams around her neighborhood, until she encountered a vehicle speeding directly towards her. The next thing she knew, she was laying on the ground with a broken hind leg. The driver sped away of course.

Ofella, still bleeding and in pain, limped to her house only to find out that her owner, the person she loved and trusted the most would simply turn her away. A kind-hearted woman that saw her plight decided to rescue poor Ofella and bring her to PAWS where she was treated. Despite the physical injury and neglect experienced from her owner, she remained a positive and happy kitty.

### Ideal Home

She can be very playful and energetic when she is around her favorite humans, but she mostly loves to spend her time just chilling. Ofella would be a nice companion to a family that can provide a safe indoor home — far away from speeding cars!
